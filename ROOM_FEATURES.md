# Room Features Update

## New Features Added

### 1. Public and Private Rooms

Users can now create and manage multiple chat rooms:

- **Public Rooms**: Accessible to all users
- **Private Rooms**: Invite-only, controlled by creator
- **Global Room**: Default room for all users
- **Room Switcher**: Left sidebar showing all available rooms

### 2. Enhanced Reaction System

Improved the message reaction feature:

- **One Reaction Per User**: Each user can only react once to a message
- **Toggle Reactions**: Click the same emoji to remove your reaction
- **Visual Feedback**: Your active reaction is highlighted in blue
- **Server Enforcement**: Server validates and enforces reaction rules
- **Better UX**: Clear indication of which emoji you've selected

## Technical Implementation

### Server Changes (server/server.js)

1. **Room Data Structure**:
   ```javascript
   const rooms = {
     'global': {
       id: 'global',
       name: 'Global Chat',
       isPrivate: false,
       createdBy: 'system',
       members: []
     }
   }
   ```

2. **New Socket Events**:
   - `create_room`: Create new public/private rooms
   - `join_room`: Join a specific room
   - `leave_room`: Leave a room
   - `invite_to_room`: Invite users to private rooms
   - `accept_invitation`: Accept room invitations

3. **Enhanced Reaction Logic**:
   ```javascript
   const userReactions = {} // Track: { messageId: { username: emoji } }
   ```
   - Removes previous reaction when user reacts again
   - Toggles off if user clicks same emoji
   - Broadcasts to room members only

4. **Room-Scoped Messages**:
   - Messages organized by room ID
   - Typing indicators per room
   - Users join Socket.io rooms for efficient broadcasting

    name: 'Tech Discussion',
    isPrivate: false,
    createdBy: 'Alice',
    createdAt: '2025-10-30T23:00:00.000Z',
    members: ['socket-id-1', 'socket-id-2']
  }
}

// Messages (organized by room)
messages = {
  'global': [...messages],
  'room-123456': [...messages]
}

// User Reactions (one per user per message)
userReactions = {
  'message-123': {
    'Alice': 'üëç',
    'Bob': '‚ù§Ô∏è'
  }
}

// Message Reactions (aggregated counts)
messageReactions = {
  'message-123': {
    'üëç': { count: 1, users: ['Alice'] },
    '‚ù§Ô∏è': { count: 1, users: ['Bob'] }
  }
}
```

## Socket.io Rooms Architecture

The application uses Socket.io's native room feature for efficient message routing:

```javascript
// User joins a room
socket.join(roomId)

// Broadcast to all users in a room
io.to(roomId).emit('receive_message', message)

// User switches rooms
socket.leave(oldRoomId)
socket.join(newRoomId)
```

## API Endpoints

New REST endpoint:
- `GET /api/rooms` - Get list of all rooms

## Testing Guide

### Test Room Creation
1. Login with username
2. Click "+" button in room sidebar
3. Enter room name
4. Select Public/Private
5. Click "Create Room"
6. Verify room appears in appropriate section

### Test Room Switching
1. Create or select a different room
2. Click on the room
3. Verify:
   - Room name updates in header
   - Messages clear and show room's history
   - Typing indicators are room-specific

### Test Private Rooms
1. Create a private room
2. Open in incognito/different browser
3. Login as different user
4. Verify private room not visible
5. (Future: Test invitation system)

### Test Reaction Limit
1. Hover over a message
2. Click an emoji (e.g., üëç)
3. Verify emoji is highlighted
4. Click a different emoji (e.g., ‚ù§Ô∏è)
5. Verify first emoji removed, new one added
6. Click same emoji again
7. Verify reaction removed completely

### Test Multi-Room Messaging
1. Create multiple rooms
2. Send messages in Room A
3. Switch to Room B
4. Send different messages
5. Switch back to Room A
6. Verify Room A messages preserved
7. Verify messages don't leak between rooms

## Performance Benefits

1. **Reduced Network Traffic**: Messages only sent to room members
2. **Better Scalability**: Rooms isolate message streams
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Messages organized per room with limits
4. **Smart Reactions**: Server prevents duplicate reactions
5. **Optimized Broadcasting**: Socket.io rooms use efficient routing
